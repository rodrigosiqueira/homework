1 - Objective
	* Create somekind of cache with device-mapper.

2 - Requirement (functional)
	+ Create a small cache that will be associate with backing storage.
		- The cache must be a small than the backing storage.
		- If you wanna try to read some datas, the cache will be checked. 
			If the data isn't in the cache, then it is necessary to fill the 
			cache.
		- If you try to write data, you must return only when the backing 
			store is complitly finished (write through). I think that this is 
			the case of write directly in the backing storage.
		- If we try to write something that exists in the cache, then it is 
			necessary to rewrite in the correct place in the backing storage
			(write back).
	+ You must to take care with the "way" that you will replace the data
		on cache. For it, you myst the implement some rule like:
			- FIFO
			- LRU

3 - Non functional requirement
	+ You can use some metadata for address translation in the cached block.
		- You can try to use Hash table, Search tree (B-tree), Journal(logging)
	+ Write back, write around caching.
	+ On-disk meta-data management.
