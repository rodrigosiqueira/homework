1 - The idea behind Device-mapper
	+ The main idea is mapping block devices onto higher-level virtual block devices.
		|PROCESSING DATA| <---> |VIRTUAL BLOCK DEVICES|----- passed to --> |BLOCK DEVICE|
		- SOME EXAMPLE: LVM2, RAID, DM-CRYPT

2 - Mapped device
	* Works by passing data from a virtual block device to another block device.

3 - Mapped device
	* Logical device provided by device-mapper drive.

4 - Mapping table
	* Represents a mapping from a mapped device to target device. Can include the 
		starting addres, lenght and the target device information.
