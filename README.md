# About this repository

> During my academic life, I did a lot of homework and simple projects.
Additionally, I'm still studying many things and constantly I'm producing some
snippet code or project with the aim to practice the new the subject. Usually,
I created one repository per class or project or study. Because of this, I
decided to stop creating a lot of repository and arrange all of them here.

# How it is organized?

> Normally, each subject has a folder. Inside of each folder, I try to keep
some information in the README file.
