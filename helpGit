======= Basic daily life with git ===========

1) In the first time that you use GIT, you must to clone the reposity:
	-> $git clone https://YOURUSERID@github.com/SOMEONE/REPOSITORY.git
	or
	-> $git clone https://YOURUSERID:PASSWORD@github.com/SOMEONE/REPOSITORY.git
	or
	-> $git clone git@github.com:SOMEONE/REPOSITORY.git

2) Before to start the work, it is necessary to update the local repository:
	-> $git pull origin master

3) If you wanna, you can create a new local branch for your local changes (it is good for you avoid to damage the master branch):
	-> $git branch NAMEOFTHEBRANCH
	-> $git checkout NAMEOFTHEBRANCH

4) After you finish your changes, you can add the files that you wanna to upload and then commit it:
	-> $git add . (or -> $git add FILENAME)
	-> $git commit -m "WRITE HERE A MESSAGE"

4.1) In the case that you produce some code with another programmers, you can commit with the line below:
	-> $git commit --author "NAME <EMAIL>, NAME2 <EMAIL>,"

5) After the local commit, you can merge it with the main branch:
	-> $git checkout master
	-> $git merge LOCALBRANCHNAME

6) Finally you can commit for the remote repository:
	-> $git push origin master

Optional) In the case that you don't wanna use the branch that you previouly create, you can remove it with:
	-> $git branch -d <<nome da branch>>

Done!
