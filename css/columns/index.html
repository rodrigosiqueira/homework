Text messaging, or texting, is the act of composing and sending electronic
messages between two or more mobile phones, or fixed or portable devices over a
phone network. The term originally referred to messages sent using the Short
Message Service (SMS). It has grown to include multimedia messages (known as
MMS) containing images, videos, and sound content, as well as ideograms known
as emoji. The service itself has different colloquialisms depending on the
region. It may simply be referred to as a text in North America, the United
Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines, an SMS in most of mainland
Europe, or an MMS or SMS in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The sender of a
text message is commonly referred to as a texter.

Text messages can be used to interact with automated systems, for example, to
order products or services, or to participate in contests. Advertisers and
service providers use direct text marketing to message mobile phone users about
promotions, payment due dates, and other notifications instead of using postal
mail, e-mail, or voicemail.
